In my recent assignment, I encountered a few challenges that tested my patience, particularly with managing project files in GitHub. Initially, I mistakenly created a test project outside of the main project folder, which led to complications when I tried to push the project to GitHub. After moving the files around, the project started to behave unexpectedly, so I decided to create a new test project entirely. This resulted in an empty test project being pushed to GitHub, alongside the correct one named "ParaCheckerTests."

For the actual implementation of the assignment, I focused on developing a method to check if the parentheses in a given string are balanced. My approach involved using a stack to handle the characters in the string. I chose a stack because it efficiently handles the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which is ideal for matching opening and closing parentheses.

The method works by iterating through each character in the string and pushing it onto the stack. As I pop each character off the stack, I check if a matching pair of parentheses ((), [], {}) is found. To ensure that the string is balanced, I used boolean variables that track whether each type of parenthesis is correctly matched. If all boolean values are true when the loop completes, the string is considered balanced.

This approach not only ensures the correctness of the solution but also highlights the importance of methodical debugging and project management, especially when working with version control systems like GitHub.
